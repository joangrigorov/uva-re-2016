# Part 1

## Name the goal(s) that you focused on, whereto the DLO should contribute.

The DLO aims to enhance the learning process.

Sub-goals:
* Student are more efficient at there studies (they can spend less time, absorbing more information).
* Information should be easily accessible to all students.

## Present the "theories" / "the way" that you developed to explain how the new "system" will impact those goals.

The DLO should:

1. Insure real-time information supply to students
  - Notifications/Announcements
  - Lecture recordings/Live lectures
2. Be a centralized place for a variety of course related actions, such as:
  - Homework descriptions access
  - Learning materials 
  - Grading
  - Notifications/Announcements
3. Ensure the opportunity for easy communication between students


## To make that new system a reality: which features / services should the new DLO offer. And what are the requirements for those features.

### 1. Course catalog:
 - The course catalog should list all the available courses, in which the student has been enrolled. 
 - The catalog should provide information for each of the courses. The information should include teacher contacts, grading information.
 - Should provide easy link to common course actions (see grades, see course materials etc.)

### 2. Course announcements
**Goal:** Insure real-time information supply to students

 - The teachers would publish immediate information notices related to course activities.
 - Notifications should be real-time.
 - Students should be able to receive notifications through e-mail as well.

### 3. Course learning materials
 - A data store with course materials (books, references, papers, publications, links) should be available for each course. 
 - Teachers would publish the necessary course materials there. 
 - Students should have access to learning materials from past course instances.
 - Searching through within this database is essential.

### 4. Homework assignments
- A special section for homework assignments should provide description and time period for the upcoming (and passed) assignments. 
- Students would also be able to hand-in their assignments using a dedicated form for the purpose.

### 5. Grading
 - Teachers (or backoffice dedicated staff) would use the DLO to insert grades for each student.
 - Students should be able to see their grades.

### 6. Video lectures
**Goal:** Insure real-time information supply to students

  - Teachers should have an easy way to record and upload there lectures.
  - Students should have an easy way to look over recorded lectures.

**Theory:** See [6] [7]

### 7. Forum/discussion board
**Goal:** Ensure the opportunity for easy communication between students

Although this is not a critical requirement, it's a good idea to have an easy way for student-to-student and teacher-to-student communicatio.

**Theory:** See [8]

# Part 2

### What did you learn about the domain?
We learnt that there is a set of core features within the existing DLO (blackboard) that users focus their needs on. Generally speaking, the most important aspects for the students are the homework assignments, announcements, course learning materials and grading.

### Which ideas were you able to refute / refine / substantiate?
- Chat-room/forums

    There were suggestions during the interviews about an integrated chat/forum system. However, a good part of the interviewed claimed that they use with ease 3rd party software for communication (apps such as Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger).
  
- UI/UX focus

    Some students addressed and emphasised on problems with accessibility, caused by poor UI/UX design. In fact, many of them claimed, that this is a core problem with the system. However, after further conversations none of the interviewees admitted that the current UI/UX design would greatly intervene with their education. Therefore, extra UI/UX features do not seem to be of a major and/or critical importance for the DLO, considering the core goal.

### What is the justification and how reliable are your findings?

To justify our findings from the requrements elicitation interview we used: 
- Literature provided in the course
- Scientific papers. 
- Researched other DLOs (edX, Coursera, Khan Academy, etc.)

Although the information acquired and backed with hard prove, should be fairly reliable, it's recommended, to never take it for granted.

### Why are these findings relevant (not a waste of your time)?
If we take as facts the claims gathered from the interviews without questioning and challenging them, we would risk assembling falsely prioritized list of requirements for the new DLO. Moreover, many of the ideas and complaints from the interviews can be considered rather nice-to-haves than actual core requirements, related to the main goal.

### How did you do your requirements engineering?
We considered not only the feedback from the interviews, but the logical outcome from reasoning and discussions afterwards. Furthermore, many of the requirements emerged during the breakdown of the available data (mainly from the interviews).

We decided that after each week, we would improve our interviews in order to avoid getting the same information again and again from the interviewees.

### What hard data did you find to justify your findings?

1. Required reading materials provided in the course.
2. Scientific papers
3. Reserach into other online learning environments

### What argumentation did you use to better think about the requirements / or to try to refute them?
TODO

### Show what you learned about requirements engineering and how this relates to the learning goals of the course.

#### Reasoning
We learnt about the wide range of ambiguity when finding **the** requirements. Furthermore, during the course we realised how our cognitive abilities infer what is a requirement and what is just _nice-to-have_. In fact, initiating logical reasoning to find _the right questions_ advocates the research nature of the requirements engineering. And this research nature can literally save an entire organization from wasting money and resources on the _wrong_ system.

In addition, we learnt more about refuting ideas in scientific/philosophical way, and how to get to the depths of reasoning around a simple statements, claim or idea.

In general, we think that the course is exactly about realizing and getting _closer to the truth_. As much as subjective _the truth_ can be, requirements engineers are meant to dive in the depths of reasoning in order to question all possible aspects, surrounding the _"system to be"_.



#### Body language and psychological patterns during communication/interviews

The major part of the performed interviews was observing the natural reactions of the interviewees, and reflecting on them. Simply put, we noticed a variety of patterns during each interview that hint about the cognitive biases of the interviewed subject. Those patterns, in general, include body language (for example folding arms and legs when the subject goes into protective state), facial expressions (eye brows movements, etc) and bi-polar statements (for example wrong answer after a question, followed by self-contradicting claims).

#### Structuring and visualizing

---

### Show what you learned about elicitation and your ability as interviewer.
TODO

### How would you gather useful  hard / objective / measurable date?
Literature research.

### What can you learn from the current use of blackboard for the future use of any DLO?
1. It's better to have a DLO, than NOT to have and DLO!
