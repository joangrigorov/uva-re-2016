# Reading & reading questions - individual assignment

## What are for this assignment the obvious sources of information to find requirements and make sense of your assignment.

We have several sources of information:
-	Our stakeholders - students, teachers, administrative staff - as main users of the current DLO system, they are the most prominent source of information for the construction of the new DLO requirements.
-	The current Blackboard system - analysis of the current DLO system, can provide valuable insight into the current valuable features and the ones that are missing.
-	Alternative DLO systems - research in the alternative DLO system, can provide valuable ideas for new features that can improve educational experience.

## Identify at least two important questions to drive the requirements engineering project for the new DLO. (if you have the answer to that question, you can derive the requirements almost intuitively) 

-	What are the problems with the current Blackboard system?
-	What improvements/new features should the new DLO system possess?

## Plan your requirements activities for the first four weeks. Provide a short rationale, referring to the documents you have read. 

Note: Although the activities are represented in a linear fashion, the process will have more of a spiral shape (Van Lamsweerde, p.32-33) – some sections will be repeated if need. For example – the process of requirements elicitation and elaboration will be repeated every week.

1. Week One
	- Identifying the stockholders - students, teachers, administrative staff
	- Understanding the domain (Van Lamsweerde, p. 30-31):
		* Research into the current Blackboard system (the system-as-is)
		* Research into alternative DLOs – available solution
	- Data gathering (requirements elicitation/Contextual Inquiry – Van Lamsweerde, p. 31-32):
		* Interviews – this a continuous process, that is done every week we gather information from our stockholders. Idea: It would be perfect if you could observe a user while he is working with blackboard.
	- Data organization and structuring – structure our data efficiently so we have easy access to it if needed. This is a continuous activity throughout all of the feature weeks.

2. Week Two
	- Data gathering:
		* Interviews – based on the finding of the previous week, we conduct more interviews to remove any existing ambiguities and gather any missing requirements
		* Interviews – based on the finding of the previous week, we conduct more interviews to remove any existing ambiguities and gather any missing requirements
	- Requirements evaluation and agreement (Van Lamsweerde, p.32-33) - we review all the information gathered until this point, clear any ambiguities, resolve any contradictions and priorities the separate raw requirements. After we finish this phase, we should how an initial requirements draft.
	- Data organization and structuring (see Week 1)
	
3. Week Three
	- Data gathering:
		* Interviews – same is previous week
	- Specification and documentation (Van Lamsweerde, p.33) – we systematically organize and structure the acquired data into a formal document (Requirements document) concerning the system requirements for the Blackboard successor system.
	- Data organization and structuring (see Week 1)
	
4. Week Four
	- Requirements consolidation (Van Lamsweerde, p.33) – after we construct the Requirements document, all the requirements must be validated via interaction with the stockholders. The week 4 interviews will be dedicated on requirements verification and if need on information gathering in case any problems arise.
	- Data organization and structuring (see Week 1)

## Based on the thesis of Nisha Jacob and your first interviews: identify the things you want to learn in interviewing.
- Gather the data needed for the requrements construction.
- Is the provided data valid?
- Is the provided relveant to the process of RE?
