# Reading & reading questions - individual assignment

## What are for this assignment the obvious sources of information to find requirements and make sense of your assignment.

We have several sources of information:
-	Our stakeholders - students, teachers, administrative staff
-	The current Blackboard system
-	Alternative DLO systems

## Identify at least two important questions to drive the requirements engineering project for the new DLO. (if you have the answer to that question, you can derive the requirements almost intuitively) 

-	What are the problems with the current Blackboard system?
-	What improvements/new features should the new DLO system possess?

## Plan your requirements activities for the first four weeks. Provide a short rationale, referring to the documents you have read. 

1. Week 1
	- Data gathering (Interviews) – this a continuous process, that is done every week (requirements elicitation or Contextual Inquiry). Idea: It would be perfect if you could observe a user while he is working with blackboard.
	- Task model construction
2. Week 2
	- Data gathering (Interviews) – based on the finding of the previous week, we conduct more interviews to remove any existing ambiguities
	- Data gathering – web research on DLO – existing solutions (features, user feedback, pricing)
	- Data organization and structuring
3. Week 3
	- Data gathering (Interviews)
	- Data consolidation
4. Week 4
	- Data gathering (Interviews)


## Based on the thesis of Nisha Jacob and your first interviews: identify the things you want to learn in interviewing.
- The data needed for the process of requirements gathering
- The validity of that data
- The relevance of the data
