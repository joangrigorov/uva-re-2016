# Video interviews week 1 - interesting findings and effective questions

## Introduction
For the first set of intereviewed about blackboard we stumbled accross students from the following specialities:
 - Business Analytics 
 - Physics 
 - Psychology

Althought that considerable part of the intervewed students claimed that they are satasfied from the service provided by blackboard there were valuable points stating the opposite. 

## Keypoints
Sorted by priority, the following keypoints were reported during the interview as domains of necessary improvement.

### Lack of search functionality
The largest group of interviewed students complained that they find it difficult to locate course materials when the amount of such is too high. In addition, no sorting/filtering is available in the very same section. 

### Usage of 3rd party software
Students reported that teachers frequently use 3rd party software services. Some of the cases, they claim, include file sharing systems (such as Dropbox). Probably shared files were too large for the capacity allowed by blackboard. Furthermore, one psychology student stated that her _Statistics and arguments_ teacher used an external SaaS for surveys and questionairs. What makes this particular case curious is the fact that blackboard actually supports surveys. One possible reason behind this might be the lack of informativity about the available features in blackbord. However, it is not yet clear if this is specifically related to poor UI/UX design, or rather lack of knowledge database. 

### Poor UI and issues
Very few from the interviewed actually addressed the UI as having a major negative impact. What was mostly mentioned, however, were possible improvements on the easy-to-access capabilities. In addition, the four physics students claimed that they were experiecing bugs and issues with the notification updates.

The the following key points can be extrapolated from the interviews:
- Most of the students are, in fact, quite satisfied with the current blackboard system and most complaints are targeted towards the interface design. They all agree that the issue with the current system are minor and far away from critical.
- The most interesting critique towards Blackboard was the lack of content search in courses. When the course content amount gets over a certain point, a good search functionality, can greatly improve the user experience.
- All of the interviewed students attended classes where not all of the course content was located on blackboard. This in turn can, and is, causing ambiguity and can possible lead to miscommunication between the student and the course teachers.
- It is possible that after the current blackboard update the system is now viewed in a better light than its previous state.
