The the following key points can be extrapolated from the interviews:
- Most of the students are, in fact, are quite satisfied with the current blackboard system and most complaints are targeted towards the interface design. They all agree that the issue with the current system are minor and far away from critical.
- The most interesting critique towards Blackboard was the lack of content search in courses. When the course content amount gets over a certain point, a good search functionality, can greatly improve the user experience.
- All of the interviewed students attended classes where not all of the course content was located on blackboard. This in turn can, and is, causing ambiguity and can possible lead to miscommunication between the student and the course teachers.
- It is possible that after the current blackboard update the system is now viewed in a better light than its previous state.
