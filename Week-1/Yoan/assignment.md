# First realizations from the reading 
After reading more about types of biases, I am curious to analyze them in the approaching conversations on daily basis, not only the RE interviews. Furthermore, while reading _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ I presume that a good interviewer should trigger a more complex process of thought in the interviewee, not only relying on intuition driven quick answers. 

# Plans for the next interviews
I am planning to enhance the interview questions by asking the interviewees about experience with science YouTube channels such as Vsauce and Veritasium. Although the purpose of doing that is to find if such vlogs can fit a DLO, I am interested to find more about the techniques the authors of those channels use that make them grasp the attention of the listeners that easily. The parallel I am making is that since we record our interviews I can also learn a lot by videos that are meant to attract the viewers attention quickly. Many people while watching those documentaries are answering some of the questions in their heads.

# Plan for the next weeks?
I am having troubles coming up with a solid plan for the next 4 weeks. It is obvious that my mind would change with the advancement in the reading and the work with my teammate. However, what I can assume is that my attention will be focused on the actual communication patterns during the interviews and how we, as a team, can improve our information gathering. 

## Small draft for the weeks

1. Week 1 - first interviews
2. Week 2 - on top of the first reading I will try to enhance my interviewing abilities, and extract richer information than before.
3. Week 3 - depending on the feedback from Week 2, I will see the direction in which I need to put more focus on. 
4. Week 4 - TBA
