# Reasons why prototyping sessions are failing

1. Intuitions vs. Formulas - depending on your intestine when conduction the prototyping sessions. A better approach is to gather all the data, without applying any intuition, and then analyze it using a firm statistical model.
2. Cognitive ease - "good" prototyping can sustain cogntive ease in session participants. In fact, by making a successful (perfect) prototype, the session collaborators could be _trapped_ by the sense of familiarity, good mood, etc. As good as it may sound, this actually decreases the participant's reasoning capabilities, which could lead to errors. On the other hand, cognitive strain would happen if participants are not fully comfortable with the prototype. Being in that state, the subjects can infer more questions, to be prone to less errors. However, cognitive strain induces less creative thinking and less intuitive abilities into the subjects.
3. Availability, Emotion, and Risk - judgment based on emotional state can adjust the _reality_ of the decision making. For example, a _good looking_ prototype may increase the trust in the customers, which can distract them from seeing issues.
On the other hand, if the subjects (customers), as part of the prototyping sessions, gain negative emotions towards the prototype, the sessions themselves can maximize a problem, that in reality is not that major. Generally speaking, this could lead to distracting the focus from the main requirements.
