# Week 2 - Reading & reading questions - individual assignment

## 1. Explore literature about emphatic listening and active listening
### Identify five verbal and non verbal cues that stimulate the interviewee in providing elaborate information.

1. Trustworthiness (verbal and nonverbal cues)
The interviewee will infer the whole communication environment more appealing if the interviewer looks more trustworthy [Todorov, p. 369].
    1. Smiling [Todorov, p. 371]

        Smiling will infer welcoming gesture from the side of the interviewer.
    2. Encouraging generic phrases

        Some small phrases smuggled between the sentences and questions of the interviewer can accommodate friendly feelings in the interviewee.
        Similar to Todorov's experiment [page 371] where phrases were used in photo descriptions to infer emotional feelings.
2. Facial expressions and body language
    1. Being an actor during the interview: Portraying welcoming emotions. This would set the facial/body language in the swing of the mood that the brain experiences. [Martinez, 3]
    2. Eye-gazing improve sound perception [Borjon, p. 1999]
3. Reflexive questions [Nisha Jacob, p. 16]
    As explained by Nisha Jacob, those type of questions are used when the interviewee has trouble phrasing their needs.

## 2. Cues that makes the interviewee stop elaborating

1. Gossiping

Creates bad reputation [Todorov, p. 369, Julian Treasure]

2. Negative statements [Todorov, p. 371]

Decreases the trustworthiness [Todorov, p. 369]

3. Judging (statements) [Julian Treasure]

4. Interruption

5. Folding arms, crossing legs (defensive behavior)

Can be triggered by a statement from the interviewee that the interviewer does not agree upon [Defensive Body Language](http://flowpsychology.com/defensive-body-language/).
