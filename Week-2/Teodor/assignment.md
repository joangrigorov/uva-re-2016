# Reading & reading questions - individual assignment

## Explore literature about emphatic listening, active listening and identify five verbal and non verbal cues that stimulate the interviewee in providing elaborate information. 

- Creates a safe and friendly enviorment for the interviewee [Zenger, Folkman, p.4]:
    * Smiles towards the interviewee
    * Has an open body posture
- Plays the role of an active listener [Zenger, Folkman, p.1-5]:
    * Asks questions towards the topics that the user is discussing [Zenger, Folkman, p.2]
    * Show genuine interest in the discussed topic
- Listens for what the interviewee has to say. Does not interupt
- Ask questions that promote discovery and insight [Zenger, Folkman, p.2]
- Reflexive questions [Jacob, p.16]


## Like the previous, but now identify five cues that stop .

Firstly the opposites of the previous point

- Interuptions
- The interviewer is defensive
    * Defensive body language - crossed arms, legs, leaning back
    * The interviewer, tries to argue with the interviewee based on personal opinions
- Gossiping

## Explain from the theory how memory works why some of the techniques yield more reliable memories than others.

From purely biological point of view, as discussed in Smithsonian magazine ["How Our Brains Make Memories"], recording a memory requires adjusting the connections between neurons. Each created memory modifies some tiny subset of the neurons in the brain, changing the way they exchange information.
