# Interviews week 2 - interesting findings and effective questions

## Introduction
This week we stumbled across students from the following specialities (showed in the same order in the video):
 1. Medical Biology, Msc
 2. Computer Science, Msc
 3. Artificial Intelligence, Msc
 4. \[Not in the video\] Software Engineering, Msc

Our questions this week were mostly focused on how exactly the students perform their studies and (MSc) projects.

## Key points

### System 1 and System 2 in conflict
It was interesting to observe an automatic quick answer to the question _"Have you ever used a system like Coursera or EDX?"_
when interviewing the software engineering student. His first answer was _"Well, no"_, but after a few seconds he started
explaining exactly about a system very similar to Coursera during his BSc.

Our conclusion is that the very first quick reaction was System 1 taking over in response to the word _Coursera_.
Generally speaking, the student did not use Coursera, this is true, but the essence of the question was about systems _like_
Coursera. Then obviously System 2 took over and he started explaining about a very similar platform that his class used
during his BSc.

### Talking about individual's professional interests works better
We frequently asked about the interviewee's master thesis, research project or main area of professional interest.
This experiment showed that the subjects are noticeably relaxed judging from their body language, posture and voice tone.
Furthermore, answering such questions extracts more information than the typical all-around questions.
